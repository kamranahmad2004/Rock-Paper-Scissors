Rock Paper and Scissor is a hand game usually played among two people where both the people form one of three objects (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) with an outstretched hand. The winner is decided based on the following:

Rock beats Scissor (Rock smashes Scissor), Scissors beats Paper (Scissor cuts Paper), Paper beats Rock (Paper wraps Rock), if both are same then it becomes draw.

Creating a Rock Paper Scissor game in Java is easy. We can create a two-player Rock Paper Scissor game in Java using switch statements or if else condition and with Java.util.Random.nextInt() 
function. The computer move would be the randomized element of list so we use Random() function on the indices of the array so that we get the randomized index between [0,2]. firstly, Opponent 
chooses it's move then player (you) choose. you can play with computer until you quit from game, after quit, you will get the overall result of all stages..
